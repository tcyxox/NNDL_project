# NNDL Project

Pre-defined project, on transfer learning.

We have prepared a dataset with images from 3 classes of entities, including bird, dog, and reptile.

Each of these classes also includes sub-classes (e.g., hawk in bird, golden retriever in dog, etc.).

The objective is to predict the correct super-class label and sub-class label for each image. An
important difficulty is that the distribution of classes may differ between training and test, and
new sub-classes may be introduced.

There will be a leaderboard for this task. Projects will be judged not based on their performance
but instead according to which approaches you explored, and description and analyses of the results
of the various methods you tried. You are not required to come up with your own method for this
type of project, but are welcome to if you’d like.
